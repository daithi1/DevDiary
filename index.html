<p>First log in my dev Diary. Me and my team have a basic idea 
of what sort of game we want to make. Unfortuantely right now
everyone is busy so we can't really get much progress on the game
but we have the lab tomorrow to work on it. Right now I have a lot
of free time so I figured I'll get to understanding the basics of
making a game as I have little experience with doing so. I'm using
the tutorial that was put up on brightspace about how to make
flappy bird on unity (which I never did on week 1 oops).
Since we are doing our game in Unity, it is definitely useful
to get to know how to use Unity and, again, understanding
the basics of making a game specifically using C#. </p>

        <p>We managed to get 6 of 8 members in a lab today to work on our project.
            None of us really have any experience with coding games so we came up
            with a plan first. We decided on the roles of what each person will
            work on for the next week just so everyone has something to work with
            and improve on. We also have a definite idea for our game so we need
            what we want to do at the very least. </p>
